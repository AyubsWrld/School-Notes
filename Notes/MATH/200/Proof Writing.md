## 6.1 | Proving Statements with Contradiction
____
- Alongside our tool bag of possible solutions to prove whether a statement is true or false , we can prove statements by *contradiction* . This process essentially entails that given a statement we can negate the proposition and if we arrive at an impossibility it implies that the original statement was true .  ==A real number x is rational if x = a b for some a,b ∈ Z. Also, x is irrational if it is not rational, that is if x 6= a b for every a,b ∈ Z.====

**We must keep a couple of fundamental definitions in mind before proceeding**
	**1)** An integer $n$ is even then it can be expressed as $2k$ for some  $k \in \ Z$
	**2)** An integer $n$ is odd then it can be expressed as $2k + 1$ for some  $k \in \ Z$
	**3)** Integers have the same parity if they are both even or both odd
	**4)** $a$ divides $b$ if there exists a value , $n$ , such that $an = b$
	**5)** $gcd(a,b)$ is the largest number which divides both $a$ and $b$ . 
	**6)**  $lcm(a,b)$ is the smallest number which is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$. 
	**7)**  Sums , differences , and products of integers are integers . 
	**8)**  The division algorithm $a = b\times q +r$ , $r$ exists if $b$ does not divide $a$ .

## Direct Proof Methods

### Proposition : If *P* $\rightarrow$ *Q* 

### Proof:            Suppose *P*
				.
				.
				.
###                        Therefore *Q* 
==Sometimes we must split things into cases ( odd or even for example )

## WLOG : Without Loss of Generality
----
Some proofs involve cases that logically lead to the same conclusion, however different the assignments of variables are . For example , given two integers whos parities differ  , can be shown by letting $a,b \in Z$ where either $a$ or $b$ differ from one another , the way we chose which variable is odd and which is even is arbitrary and wouldn't change the result of the proof , $\therefore$ we just say    ...

==**WOLOG** let $a$ be an odd integer and $b$ be an even integer  .
